# Hello_World
I am Angeck Stessy Enni, I am 22years of age soon to 23years old. I study B.Sc Management at the University of Buea awaiting graduation this December. I want to learn how to code and design not only websites but other softwares as well. I love IT and I am a poet and want to use these words to make a difference in Cameroon and Africa at large.
